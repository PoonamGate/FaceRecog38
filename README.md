# FaceRecog38

 Project: Real-time Face Recognition using Python
Overview:
Implemented a real-time face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. The system performs live face detection, recognition, and labeling in video streams from a webcam.

Key Contributions:

->Face Detection: Utilized OpenCV for face detection within video frames.
<br>
->Recognition Algorithm: Employed the face_recognition library to compare and recognize faces.
<br>
->Data Handling: Processed face encodings from images stored in the 'faces' directory.
<br>
->User Interface: Developed a graphical interface to display recognized faces in real-time with labeled confidence levels.
